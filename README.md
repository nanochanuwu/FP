# An implementation of finite automata and regular expressions in Haskell

See [report.pdf](report.pdf) for documentation.
In a nutshell, as the title suggests, in this project we implement finite automata and regular expressions in Haskell.
More specifically, we implement their data types, conversions between them, and a test suite for arbitrarily generated inputs.

Technicalities:
- To compile the project, use `stack build`.
- To run our demo, use `stack build && stack exec myprogram`.
- To play with the code, use `stack ghci`.
- To run our test suite, use `stack clean && stack test`.
